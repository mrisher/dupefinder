For various reasons, I found that my mp3 shared hard drive had a large number
of duplicate files with subtle variants. For example:
   01 - Song Number One.mp3
   01 Song Number One.mp3
   01 - Song Number One (2).mp3

I searched for a way to clean them up and couldn't find anything 
computationally efficient. This is a simple, python program to find 
duplicate MP3s in a directory and delete the less-desirable filenames.

The algorithm is based on the assumption that, within a directory,
you may have multiple files that start with the same track number. Basically,
it computes the "Levenshtein edit distance" -- the number of characters you
would need to change to edit string1 into string2 -- and then picks the one
to delete.

Enjoy.
